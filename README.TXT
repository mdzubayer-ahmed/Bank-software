There are three types of accounts: 
Savings: A user can deposit money, withdraw it with a fee up to three times per month, and earn interest on the balance, which is calculated daily and updated every 30-day cycle.
- Chequing: A user can deposit/withdraw any amount without any fees, no limits on transactions, and doesn't pay interest.
- Credit: A user can withdraw until the credit limit is reached, and adds interest to the balance if not paid in more than 30 days.
